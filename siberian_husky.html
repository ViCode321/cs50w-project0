                                <p>
                                    The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled dog breed. 
                                    The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. 
                                    It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, 
                                    erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is 
                                    smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.                                    
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where.
                                    they are bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia for sled pulling, 
                                    and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, 
                                    whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment 
                                    of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced 
                                    them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs 
                                    to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable 
                                    terrain. Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house 
                                    pet, though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by competitive 
                                    and recreational mushers.

                                    Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and 
                                    great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at 
                                    moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. Sibes are friendly, fastidious, 
                                    and dignified. The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky's almond-shaped 
                                    eyes can be either brown or blue'¿and sometimes one of each'¿and convey a 
                                    keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, 
                                    Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping 
                                    the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter 
                                    than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. As born pack dogs, they enjoy 
                                    family life and get on well with other dogs. The Sibe's innate friendliness 
                                    render them indifferent watchdogs. These are energetic dogs who can't resist 
                                    chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature 
                                    of the breed: Sibes are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.

                                <p>
                                    The Siberian Husky was originally developed by the Chukchi people of 
                                    the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Siberia. They were brought to Nome, Alaska 
                                    in 1908 to serve as working sled dogs, and were eventually developed and 
                                    used for sled dog racing. In 2015, a DNA study indicated that the Siberian 
                                    Husky, the Alaskan Malamute and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic 
                                    relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from 
                                    Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog 
                                    and the Greenland Dog. In North America, the Siberian Husky and the Malamute 
                                    both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly 
                                    to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through crossing with European 
                                    breeds. Siberian Huskies show a genetic affinity with historical East Siberian 
                                    dogs and ancient Lake Baikal dogs, and can be traced to a lineage which is 
                                    over 9,500 years old.                                </p>

                                    Several Arctic dog breeds, including the Siberian, show a significant 
                                    genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. 
                                    These breeds are associated with high latitudes - the Siberian Husky and Greenland 
                                    Dog, also associated with arctic human populations and to a lesser extent, the 
                                    Shar-Pei and Finnish Spitz. There is data to indicate admixture of between 1 and 
                                    3% between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 
                                    four high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living 
                                    in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and 
                                    challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds 
                                    descends from more than one region.                                </p>
