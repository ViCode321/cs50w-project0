                                <h1>Coat</h1>
                                <p>
                                    A Siberian Husky has a double coat that is thicker than that of most other dog breeds. 
                                    It has two layers: a dense, finely wavy undercoat and a longer topcoat of thicker, straight 
                                    guard hairs. It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, and also 
                                    reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low 
                                    as −50 to −60 °C (−58 to −76 °F). The undercoat is often absent during shedding. 
                                    Their thick coats require weekly grooming. An excessively long coat, sometimes referred 
                                    to as a "wooly" or "woolie" coat, is considered a fault by the breed's standard as it lacks 
                                    the thicker protection of the standard coat's guard hairs, obscures the dog's clear-cut 
                                    outline, causes quicker overheating during serious harness work, and becomes easily matted 
                                    and encrusted with snow and ice.

                                <p>
                                    The American Kennel Club describes the Siberian Husky's eyes as "an almond shape, moderately 
                                    spaced and set slightly obliquely." The AKC breed standard is that eyes may be brown, blue 
                                    or black; one of each or particoloured are acceptable (complete is heterochromia). These eye-color 
                                    combinations are considered acceptable by the American Kennel Club. The parti-color does not 
                                    affect the vision of the dog.

                                    Show-quality dogs are preferred to have neither pointed nor square noses. The nose is black in 
                                    gray dogs, tan in black dogs, liver in copper-colored dogs, and may be light tan in white dogs. 
                                    In some instances, Siberian Huskies can exhibit what is called "snow nose" or "winter nose." 
                                    This condition is called hypopigmentation in animals. "Snow nose" is acceptable in the show 
                                    ring.

                                    Siberian Husky tails are heavily furred; these dogs will often curl up with their tails over 
                                    their faces and noses in order to provide additional warmth. When curled up to sleep the Siberian 
                                    Husky will cover its nose for warmth, often referred to as the "Siberian Swirl". The tail should 
                                    be expressive, held low when the dog is relaxed, and curved upward in a "sickle" shape when excited 
                                    or interested in something.

                                    The breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are ideally between 20 and 24 inches 
                                    (51 and 61 cm) tall at the withers and weighing between 45 and 60 pounds (20 and 27 kg). Females 
                                    are smaller, growing to between 19 and 23 inches (48 and 58 cm) tall at the withers and weighing 
                                    between 35 and 50 pounds (16 and 23 kg).[11] The people of Nome referred to Siberian Huskies 
                                    as "Siberian Rats" due to their size of 40–50 lb (18–23 kg), versus the Alaskan Malamute's size 
                                    of 75–85 lb (34–39 kg).

                                    The Husky usually howls instead of barking. They have been described as escape artists, 
                                    which can include digging under, chewing through, or even jumping over fences. Because the 
                                    Siberian Husky had been raised in a family setting by the Chukchi and not left to fend for themselves, 
                                    they could be trusted with children. The ASPCA classifies the breed as good with children. It 
                                    also states they exhibit high energy indoors, have special exercise needs, and may be destructive 
                                    "without proper care".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Siberian Huskies have a high prey drive due to the Chukchi allowing them to roam free in the summer. 
                                    The dogs hunted in packs and preyed on wild cats, birds, and squirrels, but with training can be 
                                    trusted with other small animals. They would only return to the Chukchi villages when the snow returned 
                                    and food became scarce. Their hunting instincts can still be found in the breed today, noted by their 
                                    typically high prey-drive. A 6 ft (1.83 m) fence is recommended for this breed as a pet, although 
                                    some have been known to overcome fences as high as 8 ft (2.44 m). Electric pet fencing may not be 
                                    effective. They need the frequent companionship of people and other dogs, and their need to feel 
                                    as part of a pack is very strong.
