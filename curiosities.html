                            <p>
                                The husky is probably one of the dogs that most reminds us of the wolf,
                                probably because of its pointy ears, penetrating gaze, and pronounced muzzle.
                                Of course, remember that recent studies indicate that the dog does not descend from the wolf,
                                but they are close relatives.
                            </p>

                                However, the Siberian husky is smaller than these large predators, since
                                that the husky reaches around 56 and 60 centimeters in height at the withers,
                                while wild wolves can measure between 80 or 85 centimeters
                                tall at the withers.

                                Having one eye of each color is known as "heterochromia" and this quality 
                                is generally due to a genetic mutation, which is hereditary. Heterochromia 
                                is present in many species of animals, such as humans, and the truth is 
                                that it causes

                            <p>
                                The husky is a dog that adapts without problems to cold and icy climates: its coat 
                                is testimony to its origins in Siberia. However, surprisingly, the husky is also 
                                capable of adapting to temperate climates, unlike other Nordic dogs, such as the 
                                Alaskan malamute, which usually suffers intense heat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The husky sheds its coat twice a year, once between spring and summer and once 
                                between fall and winter. However, between the two moults, hair loss can also occur, 
                                always in small amounts. In the case of observing more loss than normal, it is advisable 
                                to go to the vet to rule out allergies and other health problems.

                                away. Some huskies appear to sing, talk, and even whine, however, they do 
                                not usually bark.

                                It's no secret that huskies love snow. Virtually all individuals 
                                show some interest in it, probably because of the profound impact 
                                this element has had on their history. Perhaps for this reason 
                                they are also attracted to water and leaf litter in autumn.

                                Along with the Chukchi tribe, huskies worked as sled 
                                dogs, carrying food and supplies from one place to 
                                another, and contrary to popular belief, huskies did 
                                not usually transport people. They were chosen to 
                                carry out this task for various reasons, such as 
                                resistance to cold, but mainly their ability to make 
                                long journeys stood out. The sled was towed by about 
                                twenty dogs and each of them performed a specific 
                                function.

                                It is undoubtedly an excellent playmate for children, a member of the team 
                                when going on excursions or a sensitive and affectionate dog on a daily

                                Probably if we think of war dogs, the story of the 
                                German shepherd comes to mind, used as a messenger, 
                                rescue dog and even as a "mine" dog. However, the 
                                husky also stands out in the Second World War, 
                                carrying out transport and communication tasks.

                            <p>
                                By far, the story of Balto, a mixed-breed husky, is one of the 
                                most impressive surrounding the breed, in fact, his popularity was 
                                such that Disney released two films explaining his story.                                        
                            </p>     
                            <p>
                                It all starts in 1925, when a large number of children in a town 
                                called Nome, Alaska, contracted diphtheria. Faced with the impossibility 
                                of receiving the necessary medicines, a group of men together with their 
                                dogs decided to undertake a dangerous journey to save the lives of the 
                                town's children.                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some men and dogs died, including the guide dogs, however, Balto was 
                                the one who took command of the race, despite having no previous 
                                experience as a leader. Fortunately, after five and a half days, they 
                                reached their destination. The dogs were hailed as heroes and were 
                                featured in newspapers across the country.
