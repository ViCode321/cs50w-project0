                            Siberian Huskies are intelligent and have an innate desire to work; they are highly 
                            active and require vigorous exercise and space to run. Huskies make excellent jogging 
                            partners in cool weather! She is not much of a barker, but she is a communal howler 
                            especially when bored or under-exercised. The Siberian Husky is a generally healthy 
                            breed with an average lifespan of 11-14 years.

                            <p>
                                We know that because you care so much about your dog, you want to take good 
                                care of her. That is why we have summarized the health concerns we will be 
                                discussing with you over the life of your Husky. By knowing about health concerns 
                                specific to Siberian Huskies, we can tailor a preventive health plan to watch 
                                for and hopefully prevent some predictable risks.

                                Many diseases and health conditions are genetic, meaning they are related to your 
                                pet’s breed. There is a general consensus among canine genetic researchers and 
                                veterinary practitioners that the conditions we’ve described herein have a 
                                significant rate of incidence and/or impact in this breed. That does not mean 
                                your dog will have these problems; it just means that she is more at risk than 
                                other dogs. We will describe the most common issues seen in Siberian Huskies to 
                                give you an idea of what may come up in her future. Of course, we can’t cover 
                                every possibility here, so always check with us if you notice any unusual signs 
                                or symptoms.

                        <h3>Dental Disease</h3>
                        <p>
                            Dental disease is the most common chronic problem in pets, affecting 80% of all dogs by age two. 
                            Unfortunately, your Siberian Husky is more likely than other dogs to have problems with her teeth. 
                            Dental disease starts with tartar build-up on the teeth and progresses to infection of the gums 
                            and roots of the teeth. If we don’t prevent or treat dental disease, your buddy may lose her 
                            teeth and be in danger of damage to her kidneys, liver, heart, and joints. In fact, your Husky’s 
                            life span may even be cut short by one to three years! We’ll clean your dog’s teeth regularly and 
                            let you know what you can do at home to keep those pearly whites clean.

                            Siberian Huskies are susceptible to bacterial and viral infections — the same ones that 
                            all dogs can get — such as parvo, rabies, and distemper. Many of these infections are preventable 
                            through vaccination, which we will recommend based on her age, the diseases we see in our area, 
                            and other factors.

                        <p>
                            Obesity can be a significant health problem in Siberian Huskies. It is a
                            serious disease that may cause or worsen joint problems, metabolic and 
                            digestive disorders, back pain, and heart disease. Though it’s tempting to 
                            give your pal food when she looks at you with those soulful eyes, you 
                            can “love her to death” with leftover people food and doggie treats. Instead, 
                            give her a hug, brush her fur or teeth, play a game with her, or perhaps take 
                            her for a walk. She’ll feel better, and so will you!

                            All kinds of worms and bugs can invade your Husky’s body, inside and out. Everything from fleas and ticks to ear mites can infest her skin and ears. Hookworms, roundworms, heartworms, and whipworms can get into her system in a number of ways: drinking unclean water, walking on contaminated soil, or being bitten by an infected mosquito. Some of these parasites can be transmitted to you or a family member and are a serious concern for everyone. For your canine friend, these parasites can cause pain, discomfort, and even death, so it’s important that we test for them on a regular basis. We’ll also recommend preventive medication as necessary to keep her healthy.

                        <p>
                            One of the best things you can do for your Husky is to have her spayed (neutered for males). In females, this means we surgically remove the ovaries and usually the uterus, and in males, it means we surgically remove the testicles. Spaying or neutering decreases the likelihood of certain types of cancers and eliminates the possibility of your pet becoming pregnant or fathering unwanted puppies. Performing this surgery also gives us a chance, while your pet is under anesthesia, to identify and address some of the diseases your dog is likely to develop. For example, if your pet needs hip X-rays or a puppy tooth extracted, this would be a good time—it’s more convenient for you and easier on your friend too. Routine blood testing prior to surgery also helps us to identify and take precautions against common problems that increase anesthetic or surgical risk. Don’t worry; we’ll discuss the specific problems we will be looking for when the time arrives.                        </p>

                        <h3>Eye Problems</h3>
                        <p>
                            Not many things have as dramatic an impact on your dog’s quality of life as the proper functioning of his eyes. Unfortunately, Siberian Huskies can inherit or develop a number of different eye conditions, some of which may cause blindness if not treated right away, and most of which can be extremely painful! We will evaluate his eyes at every examination to look for any signs for concern.                  
                        </p>

                                        Cataracts are a common cause of blindness in older Huskies. We’ll watch for the lenses of his eyes to become more opaque—meaning they look cloudy instead of clear—when we examine him. Many dogs adjust well to losing their vision and get along just fine. Surgery to remove cataracts and restore sight may also be an option.                                        
                                    </a>

                                    <a>
                                        Glaucoma, an eye condition that affects Siberian Huskies and people too, is an extremely painful disease that rapidly leads to blindness if left untreated. Symptoms include squinting, watery eyes, bluing of the cornea (the clear front part of the eye), and redness in the whites of the eyes. Pain is rarely noticed by pet owners though it is frequently there and can be severe. People who have certain types of glaucoma often report it feels like being stabbed in the eye with an ice pick! Yikes! In advanced cases, the eye may look enlarged or swollen like it’s bulging. We’ll perform an annual glaucoma screening to diagnose and start treatment as early as possible. Glaucoma is a medical emergency. If you see symptoms, don’t wait to call us, go to an emergency clinic!

                                        Pannus is like a suntan on your dog’s eyeball. In affected breeds, inflammatory cells infiltrate the cornea (the clear part of the eye), which then darkens with exposure to ultraviolet light, and may lead to complete blindness. It’s considered to have a genetic component, since the condition is predominant in certain breeds, like your Siberian Husky. We’ll watch his eyes closely for early signs and start preventive eye medications if needed. Doggie sunglasses are also an option to help reduce sun exposure.

                        <p>
                            There are several types of inherited bleeding disorders that occur in dogs. They range in severity from very mild to very severe. Many times a pet seems normal until a serious injury occurs or surgery is performed, and then severe bleeding can result. Von Willebrand’s disease is a blood clotting disorder frequently found in Siberian Huskies. We’ll conduct diagnostic testing for blood clotting times or a specific DNA blood test for Von Willebrand’s disease and other similar disorders to check for this problem before we perform surgery.

                        <h3>Epilepsy</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are three types of seizures in dogs: reactive, secondary, and primary. Reactive seizures are caused by the brain’s reaction to a metabolic problem like low blood sugar, organ failure, or a toxin. Secondary seizures are the result of a brain tumor, stroke, or trauma. If no other cause can be found, the disease is called primary or idiopathic epilepsy. This problem is often an inherited condition, and Siberian Huskies are commonly afflicted. If your friend is prone to seizures, episodes will usually begin between six months and three years of age. An initial diagnostic workup may help find the cause. Lifelong medication is usually necessary to help keep seizures under control with periodic blood testing required to monitor side effects and efficacy. If your dog has a seizure, carefully prevent him from injuring himself, but don’t try to control his mouth or tongue. It won’t help him, and he may bite you accidentally! Note the length of the seizure, and call us or an emergency hospital.

                        <p>
                            Huskies may develop a disease called laryngeal paralysis in which the vocal cords become paralyzed and hang down into the airway. The primary symptom is noisy breathing, especially when outside in hot, humid weather or after exercising, but in severe cases, a pet can collapse and have difficulty breathing as well. Treatment may include environment control and medication. Bring your pet in right away if you notice signs of respiratory distress before the problem becomes a surgical emergency!

                            Huskies are more likely than other breeds to have high blood pressure, also called hypertension, which may occur independently or be caused by another disease. High blood pressure can cause blindness and strokes in dogs, just as it can in people. The Vida Veterinary Care medical team will test his blood pressure on a regular basis and prescribe blood pressure medication if needed.

                        <p>
                            Some breeds, like your Husky, can be born with a variety of heart defects. Most affect the structure of the heart’s dividing wall or the vessels of the heart. Defects can also cause problems with heart valve function or the electrical signals that control the heartbeat. Because of the significant risk of heart disease in this breed, we’ll pay special attention to his heart during each examination. Special testing will be recommended if we hear a heart murmur or if you notice any unusual symptoms such as tiring easily, coughing, a swollen belly, or fainting.

                                Cancer is a leading cause of death in older dogs. Your Husky will likely live longer than many other breeds and therefore is more prone to get cancer in his golden years. Many cancers are curable by surgical removal, and some types are treatable with chemotherapy. Early detection is critical! We’ll perform periodic diagnostic tests and look for lumps and bumps when we examine your pet.                            </p>

                        <p>
                            Huskies are prone to a form of skin infection called zinc-responsive dermatosis in which a pet either doesn’t get enough zinc in his diet or his body doesn’t absorb it properly. Signs include red, hairless, crusting, scaling, or oozing skin around the mouth, chin, eyes, or ears, and lesions on the footpads or nose. If your dog develops this disease, we’ll prescribe a carefully regulated amount of added zinc to his diet.

                        <p>
                            Much of what you can do to keep your dog happy and healthy is common sense, just like it is for people. Watch her diet, make sure she gets plenty of exercise, regularly brush her teeth and coat, and call us or a pet emergency hospital when something seems unusual (see “What to Watch For” below). Be sure to adhere to the schedule of examinations and vaccinations that we recommend for her. This is when we’ll give her the necessary “check-ups” and test for diseases and conditions that are common in Huskies. Another very important step in caring for your pet is signing up for pet health insurance. There will certainly be medical tests and procedures she will need throughout her life and pet health insurance will help you cover those costs.

                                        Give her a thorough brushing at least weekly most of the year. Twice a year she blows her coat and loses crazy amounts of hair; daily brushing is recommended during this time.
